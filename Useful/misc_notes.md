#### Protecting the radio

For how wonderful the RTLSDR is, it has some limitations. We need to make sure that our Rx power stays below +10dBm (10mW). What is convenient is that at 50 ohms this corresponds to about 2Vpp, so most common diodes will do the trick.

Since I am lazy I'll be using [KK5JY's study](https://www.kk5jy.net/rf-clipper/) on this for inspiration.

The 1N4148 can be used :D
